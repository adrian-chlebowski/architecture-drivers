# Architecture drivers
This repository describes the architecture drivers that drive the direction of application development

## Functional requirements

How the application is supposed to work. 
These requirements state what the system must do, and how it must behave or react to runtime stimuli.

## Quality attribute requirements. 

These requirements are qualifications of
the functional requirements or of the overall product. A qualification of a
functional requirement is an item such as how fast the function must be
performed, or how resilient it must be to erroneous input. A qualification
of the overall product is an item such as the time to deploy the product or a
limitation on operational costs e.g. testability, observability, reliability, scalability, availability, security, usability

## Constraints

Project constraints , project knowledge, how time is to implementation. 

A constraint is a design decision with zero degrees of freedom.
That is, it’s a design decision that’s already been made. Examples include
the requirement to use a certain programming language or to reuse a certain
existing module, or a management fiat to make your system service oriented. These choices are arguably in the purview of the architect, but external factors (such as not being able to train the staff in a new language, or
having a business agreement with a software supplier, or pushing business
goals of service interoperability) have led those in power to dictate these
design outcomes.
